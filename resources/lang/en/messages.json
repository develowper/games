  "dooz_roles": "Rules of 9-Men's Morris\nPlacing Phase:\n\nEach player has 9 pieces and takes turns placing them on board intersections.\nIf a player forms a straight line of 3 pieces, they can remove an opponent’s piece (except those in a mill).\nMoving Phase:\n\nAfter placing all pieces, players move their pieces one step along board lines.\nForming a mill again allows removal of an opponent’s piece.\nFlying Phase:\n\nWhen a player has only 3 pieces left, they can 'fly' their pieces to any empty spot (not limited to one-step moves).\n✅ The winner is the player who reduces the opponent to fewer than 3 pieces or blocks all their moves."
